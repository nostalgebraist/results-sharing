# Agentic misalignment variants

Some variants I wrote adapting the blackmail (replacement, no goal conflict) scenario from [Agentic Misalignment](https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/agentic-misalignment/).

These were written quickly and may have issues [^1].

They aren't the only variants I've tried, just ones for which I thought the results were somewhat interesting.

**This should not be interpreted as a "fixed"/"improved" version of the original scenario, just a variant of it that I felt like sharing (in the context of a particular ongoing discussion).**

[^1]: One minor one I'm aware of is that the user message still claims the emails are chronologically ordered but that's not always the case; IIUC this is also true in the original scenario I'm adapting.
